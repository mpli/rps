            We will take up to 4 separate one-week vacations during the year, but not during the critical summer months. We will make sure your pool is properly balanced and chemicals will last during the time we take off. We will leave a door hanger informing you one week prior to our vacation time. Our prices reflect us physically servicing your pool 48 weeks in a year.
